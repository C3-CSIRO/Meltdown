Description of Contents Map as well as its limitations.

Well: This is just the position or name of the well ie. "A1" or "D8"

Condition Variable 1 : This is the condition variable that the wells are grouped together by. There is no limitation on the number of unique entries.
Eg If you have a condition variable 1 that is "Salt Only" then all the wells that have this Condition Variable 1 will appear on the same in depth graph and be in the same column on the summary graph.

Condtion Variable 2 : This is the condition variable that distinguishes wells that have the same Condition Variable 1 apart from each other. A maximum of 6 unique values can be entered if not using d(pH)/dT and a maximum of 3 unique values can be entered if using d(pH)/dT.
Eg If you have a Condition variable 2 that is "50mM NaCl" then all the wells that have this Condition Variable 2 will have the same colour points on the summary graph and will be graphed with the same colour on all the in depth graphs.

pH: This is the pH of the well. If you want to use pH for either Condition variable 1 or Condition variable 2 just leave this column blank.

d(pH)/dT: If you want to use pH adjustment for the Tm then enter the d(pH)/dT of the solution into this column. If you do not want to use pH adjustment then just leave this column blank.

isControl: This is used to distiguish which wells are controls and should not be used in analysis. For a control well put a 1 and for a well that is not a control leave the cell blank.
