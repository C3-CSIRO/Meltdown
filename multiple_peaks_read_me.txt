For Laura's double peak meltdown

in the file DsfWell.py at the top there is a constant TM_STEEPNESS_THRESH. Setting this sets the sensitivity to finding more tms.
In the settings.ini, under running options, MaxTmsPerCurve will set the max number of Tms to look for

A few features of meltdown are currently disabled for the multiple tms to output, such as the Lysozyme control check. Ignore these issues :)
