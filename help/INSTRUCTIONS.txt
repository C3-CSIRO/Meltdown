	distribution for your computer (Windows/Mac/Linux).


2.	Install Anaconda by running the installer. Make sure you select
	to install Anaconda for all users and let it install in the default
	directory and with all the default settings.


3.	Install ReportLab by
	
	a)  On Windows: Open Anaconda Prompt from start menu
	    On Mac/Linux: Open a terminal
	
	b)  Type the command "conda install reportlab" and press enter.

	c)  Type "y" and press enter to continue when asked if you want to proceed.


4.	Go to the meltdown github (https://github.com/C3-CSIRO/Meltdown) and press 'Download zip' in the lower right
	section of the page. Extract the the zip to a location of your choice



Running Meltdown
===============================================================================
1.	Prepare a DSF results file in the correct format.
	- Title the temperature column "Temperature",
	- Title the headers of each well's melt data with a unique well name.
	- The file should be tab delimited, and in .txt format.
	
	
	** If you need more help getting a DSF results file: **
	** There is a sample DSF results file located in the "help" folder in meltdown's directory **


	If you are running a CFX machine, you can export directly to the supported format:
		a)  Open the DSF .pcrd file that you want to analyse in the CFX Manager
		b)  Export the pcrd file to text files (tab delimited);
		c)  Ensure that you have updated your BioRad software to version 3.1 or later
		d)  For version 3.1
			Click the "Export" menu, select "Export All Data Sheets" and select
			"Text (*.txt)"

2.	Prepare a Contents Map file in the correct format.
	- Compulsory column headers (without quotes, case sensitive): "Well", "Condition Variable 1", "Condition Variable 2"
	- Optional column headers: "pH", "d(pH)/dT", "Control"
	- Each row should describe the condition of a well in the DSF results file, and each well name under "Well" should
	  correspond uniquely to a well name in the DSF results file


	** If you need more help getting a contents map: **
	** There is a sample Contents Map file located in the "help" folder in meltdown's directory **


3.	Run Meltdown by 

	On Windows: running the "RunMeltdown.bat" file located in the meltdown folder downloaded from github
	On Mac/Linux: running the "RunMeltdownUnix.command" file located in the meltdown folder downloaded from github


4. 	Dialogs will pop up asking you to select the "DSF Experiment results" and the 
	"Contents Map". Select the appropriate files.


5. 	Meltdown will now run. The results will be outputted to a .pdf file in
	the directory where the DSF experiments results file was located.
